			<p class = "ReviewText">Lamborghini has always been one of my favourite car makers of all time. Their naturally aspirated engines have been unbeatable and in a world were naturally aspirated engines are dying, Lamborghini seems to continue making them. There is nothing better sounding than a naturally aspirated V12. Being in an Aventador S before was the best experience in my life. Now that I have this SVJ, it&rsquo;s just a dream come true. Instant power = instant fun. By far one of the best cars ever made!</p>

			<p class="ReviewText">The Mclaren Senna is by far the best track car available on the road today. With it&rsquo;s super-light weight and rigid chasis, to it&rsquo;s V8 engine. The Senna is a perfect example of function over form. When Mclaren was designing the Senna, they wanted it to work as best as possible by sacrificing looks. Personally, it looks amazing but most people think it looks ugly. But this was a small cost to pay since it&rsquo;s aerodynamic functions outweigh its &lsquo;bad looks&rsquo;.</p>

			<p class="ReviewText">By far one of the best Porsches today is the GT3 RS 991.2. From it&rsquo;s 9000 rpm redline to the magnificent interior, this is one of their best cars yet. It&rsquo;s incredibly fast and places down the power amazingly. And it&rsquo;s looks, well thats a different story. It simply looks beautiful. The lines on the car are seemless and in flows so well. It has a sense of class as well as that raw sport emotion. It&rsquo;s truly one of the best cars ever!</p>

			<p class="ReviewText">There is no complete garage if you don&rsquo;t have a Mercedes-Benz. Their heritage and resume says it all. Every car they make is properly manufactured to the best of their abilities. The quality is first-class and the speed is on a whole different level. AMG vehicles are well known for their naturally aspirated engines but due to goverment regulations, they were forced to adapt and use turbos. As a result, Mercedes-Benz has been able to master the use of turbos providing an amazing driving experience.</p>

			<p class="ReviewText">Eversince the Volkswagen group purchased Lamborghini, the Audi R8 has been phenomenal. The Lamborghini Huracan is by far the best affordable super car ever built. So when Audi was making a new R8, they wanted it to be the best R8 ever. So they based it off the Huracan. This allowed the R8 to take that amazing naturally aspirated V10 engine and the same sensational chasis. Paired with Audi&rsquo;s Virtual Cockpit, the new R8 V10 Plus spyder is arguably the best R8 ever built.</p>

			<p class="ReviewText">Last but not least, is the new Ford GT Carbon Series. It is absolutely insane. When Ford was forced to reduce their CO2 Emissions, they changed from their amazing V8&rsquo;s to their V6 Ecoboost engines. This was extremely controversial since that nice American Muscle Car sound was gone. Although it was tough for them to make this change, it ended up helping them a lot because it allowed them more space to place turbos. This in turn made the Ford GT much lighter and faster. The carbon series makes it even lighter which just says how far Ford has gone to provide premium performance.</p>
